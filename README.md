# Super Cool Jumpy Jump
First game made with Godot 3.2  
Godot can be found [here](https://godotengine.org/)  
Godot is pretty powerful and getting better with each release.  
You can export your projects to Winblowz, MacOSX, Crapple, Android, and HTML5!  
  
# Project is based on a tutorial
You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxboW7x0jZqFdvMdCFKTMsQ)  
This project has morphed into a bit of a frankengame from the original tutorial.  
If you are thinking about learning Godot, this is pretty good. A few others I've  
found that look good as well
